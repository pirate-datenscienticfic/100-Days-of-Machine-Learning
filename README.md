# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning
keep doing, keep chilling

Daily log is to track the progress made by me on 100Days of ML coding challenge. At the 100th day 
to see myself what is difference between Day-1 and Day-100 and also differnce are betterment from 
previous days.

## Description ##

100 Days ML challenge and to learns ML end to end from zero to mastery levels. This challenge focus
more on the production environment rather than the concepts and theory behind ML/DL models. I will 
be applying ML pipeline and the process of taking an ML model and applying into a real-world 
application.

### Web Resources ###

- [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/)

## Challenge Goals ##

- Learn how to deploy ML models into production.
- Learn about the ML Pipeline.
- Learn more about privacy & protection for ML applications.
- Learn the CI/CD for ML.
- Learn about CUDA and get hands on Experience.
- Learn more about Reinforcement Learning.
- Learn more about Generative Learning.
- Learn about AWS microservies.
